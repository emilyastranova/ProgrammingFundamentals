Howdy, how are you all? Hope you all healthy    and                    
you really do    some study at home. It is already   4 weeks after 
the spring break, do you miss school?   haha!                       
    Well, our face-face class changed to face  -  screen now. You   
didn't predict that, I didn't either. No matter what we need to     
do something and move on, right> so be it!
